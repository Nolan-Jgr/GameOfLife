To start, the number 0 means dead and the number 1 means alive. A 5x5 array is initialized randomly with 0's and 1's.
The game then games through a series of generations where the rules are as follows:
1)If the cell has 3 neighbors and is dead, it will come back to life
2)If the cell has 2 or 3 neighbors and is alive, it will stay alive
3)Otherwise, the cell is killed
